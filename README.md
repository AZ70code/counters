<h2>Counters and Graph</h2>

In this project, I created an animation of various statistics on the site. The data value and animation speed are set in the html document using attributes           <code>data-count</code>, <code>data-count-speed</code>. Also, the animation of the graphical presentation of statistical data is implemented in the project. When you hover over a graph column, its value is displayed, which corresponds to its height. The displayed value is set using the attribute <code>data-col-height</code>
